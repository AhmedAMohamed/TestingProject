to start writing use @name theGraphName
Ex:
  @name test

Second line should be the total number of nodes by using #number = number
Ex:
  #number = 5
              Note that you should not use more or less spaces than the shown in the example

Then a single line that shows al the lables of the nodes by using ls nodes
Ex:
  ls 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , ......
              Note that the nodes is generated in assending order of numbers
              
Then identifing the initial node by using # number starts
Ex:
  # 0 starts
  
Then identifing the last node by using # number ends
Ex:
  # 4 ends

Then a single line that shows the starting point of inserting the edges by using @begin 
Ex: 
  @begin

Then finite number of edges that user inserts in this following syntax from >> to
Ex:
  0 >> 1
  1 >> 2
           Note that you should not use more or less spaces than the shown in the example

Finally after inserting all the edges the identification that the process of inserting all the edges by using @end
Ex:
  @end
  
Last closing the file by using @end theGraphName
Ex:
  @end theGraphName

Notes about the yak syntax:
                            The comments is allowed by using // before the comment line
                            The syntax is not a case sensetive no mater if capital or small
                            The spacing is a must no more or less spacing can be allowed within the command line
